            <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
            <h2>Chapter 1: My Life Journey</h2>
            <p class="intro">My name is Noel Miranda, and I was born and raised in a 
               town where community and learning were always central to my
               upbringing. Growing up, I developed a deep curiosity about 
               how things work, whether it was tinkering with gadgets or 
               understanding societal issues. <span class="sentence">This passion for learning has 
               stayed with me, shaping my journey into Criminal Justice, 
               Sociology, and Applied Science before I found my path in 
               software development.</span> Every step along the way has been 
               about growing my knowledge and skills, aiming to make a 
               real-world impact.</p>
            <p>Family and community have always played an important
               role in my life. I was fortunate to be surrounded by people 
               who valued education and hard work, and this instilled in me
               a strong desire to excel. Whether it was through academic 
               achievements, like graduating summa cum laude, or taking on 
               challenges in my current work at Target, I have always sought 
               to combine hard work with creativity to find solutions. My 
               family continues to be my support system as I pursue my 
               software development degree and new professional opportunities.</p>
            <p>Outside of school and work, I have always enjoyed mentoring
               others and building projects that help people. In my free 
               time, I love experimenting with different coding languages 
               and technologies, especially when it leads to solving 
               practical problems. Recently, I took on a project at work 
               where I created a system using Excel that allowed for efficient
               station assignments. This hands-on approach to problem-solving 
               energizes me, and I am always looking for new ways to improve 
               processes.</p>
            <p>In addition to my professional and academic interests, I am 
               passionate about continuous learning and improvement in all 
               aspects of life. I love reading self-development books that 
               inspire growth and new perspectives. Outside of tech, I also 
               enjoy working out regularly to stay healthy and balanced. Traveling 
               with my fianc√© is another important part of my life, as we love
               exploring new places and cultures together. These activities help
               me maintain a well-rounded lifestyle, fueling both my personal 
               and professional growth.</p>
